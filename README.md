Problem Statement: Infant cry reason detector
Problem Statement ID : PYS112
       Design and develop an Infant Cry Reason Detector that can accurately classify baby cries into predefined categories: belly pain, hungry, burping, discomfort, and tired. The system should utilize machine learning techniques to analyze audio recordings of infant cries and predict the underlying reason, aiding parents and caregivers in understanding and responding to a baby's needs effectively.


Project Overview: Infant Cry Reason Detector
Purpose:
Infants communicate their needs primarily through crying, and identifying the reason behind their cries is crucial for timely and appropriate caregiving. However, parents, especially first-time caregivers, often struggle to interpret these cries, leading to distress for both the baby and the caregiver. This project aims to bridge this gap using AI-powered cry analysis.

Objective:
The goal of this project is to develop an AI-based Infant Cry Reason Detector that classifies baby cries into five categories:
Belly pain
Hungry
Burping
Discomfort
Tired
This system will help parents, caregivers, and healthcare professionals respond more effectively to an infant’s needs.
